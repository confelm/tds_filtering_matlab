## Step-by-step instructions to  process data according to the methodology described in "Guidelines for asset pricing research using international equity data from Thomson Reuters Datastream" (Landis and Skouras, 2019)

### Set-up

1. You will need a windows PC with MATLAB® 2017a or later and Microsoft Office® 2010 or later  installed.
2. Download zip file `tds_filtering_matlab.zip` with appropriate code from : https://tinyurl.com/yxjhphh6 .
3. Unzip `tds_filtering_matlab.zip`, to a directory of your choice. 
4. You must have extracted raw data following all steps described in Landis and Skouras' (2019) Internet Appendix. You will need to have noted the `"UserDirectory"`  used in Section A.2, Step 1 of page 2.
Alternatively, for the purpose of testing this data processing code, you can download `sample_data.zip` from: https://tinyurl.com/yyblu5cl and copy it to `"UserDirectory"`.

### Process raw data

1. Execute `process_tds.bat`
2. Provide `"UserDirectory"` as defined above to the dialog box which is generated by the script
3. After the run is complete, processed data will be available in `"UserDirectory"\data\processed\`.
Data wil be organized in folders according to TDS' country naming conventions, for example data for Argentina will be stored in `"UserDirectory"\data\processed\argentina\`.
