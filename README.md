## Process TDS data

### Update repository

1. Goto: [https://xxx]
2. Clone/unpack to a local directory of your choice. 
3. Verify MATLAB® 2017a or later and Microsoft Office® 2010 or later is installed. 

### Prepare sample 

1. Goto: [https://xxx] to download data extraction guide. 

2. Follow all steps described in document to collect the sample. 
   Alternatively Goto : [https://drive.google.com/open?id=169yO3pnM8rJ5kjLRyLg235KAv-sXX_DA], to download a sample of TDS data. 

3. Copy the data to specific directory (`"UserDirectory"` moving forward, for example, `C:\tmp\tds` for pc or `/home/tmp/tds` for Unix operating systems). 

### Process raw TDS data

1. Open `process_tds.bat` script for Windows OS or execute `process_tds.sh` script in terminal for Unix OS. 
2. Provide `"UserDirectory"` to the dialog box which is generated by the script, for example, `C:\tmp\tds` for pc or `/home/tmp/tds` for Unix operating systems. 

```
sh process_tds.sh
```

## Processed data guidelines 

1. Processed data can be found under: `"UserDirectory"\data\processed\` in pc, or under: `"UserDirectory"/data/processed` in Unix operating systems. 
   Data are organized in folders following country naming conventions, for example data for Argentina would be stored in `"UserDirectory"\data\processed\argentina\`.
