### Update repository

1. Clone/unpack to a local directory of your choice. 
3. Verify MATLAB® 2017a or later and Microsoft Office® 2010 or later is installed. 

### Prepare sample 

1. Open `data_extraction_guide.pdf`
2. Follow all steps described in document to fetch raw TDS data. Alternatively you can download a sample from: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=169yO3pnM8rJ5kjLRyLg235KAv-sXX_DA].
3. Copy the data to `"UserDirectory"` as defined in guide, section 2 step 1 at page 1, for example : `C:\tds` for pc or `/home/tds` for Unix operating systems. 

### Process raw TDS data

1. Open `process_tds.bat` script for Windows OS or execute `process_tds.sh` script in terminal for Unix OS. 
2. Provide `"UserDirectory"` to the dialog box which is generated by the script, for example, `C:\tds` for pc or `/home/tds` for Unix operating systems. 
```
sh process_tds.sh
```
### Processed data - Output

Processed data can be found under: `"UserDirectory"\data\processed\` in pc, or under: `"UserDirectory"/data/processed` in Unix operating systems. 
   Data are organized in folders following country naming conventions, for example data for Argentina would be stored in `"UserDirectory"\data\processed\argentina\`.
